## What This Course Offers

This course teaches MYGA products the way they are analyzed in real work:  
**contract features → cash flow mechanics → model outputs → reserving intuition**.

### Core Focus Areas

- Annuity fundamentals
  - Deferred vs. immediate annuities
  - Risk allocation across phases
- MYGA mechanics
  - Interest crediting
  - Guaranteed fund / MGSV
  - Surrender charges and cash surrender values
  - Partial withdrawal provisions
- Policy illustration modeling (Python)
  - Monthly projections
  - Policy-year logic
  - Clean, auditable outputs
- Reserving intuition
  - CARVM concepts
  - VM-22 framework (conceptual and explainable, not black-box)

## Course Structure

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| Delivery | One-on-one online instruction |
| Format | Lecture + guided walkthrough |
| Homework | Conceptual, numerical, and Python exercises |
| Tools | Python, Jupyter / Colab, Markdown |
| Outcome | Resume-ready project artifacts |

!!! note "Study method"
    Each session is paired with homework. The homework is designed to progressively build a **MYGA illustration engine** that you can reuse and extend.

## MYGA Term Durations Covered

We explicitly model and compare MYGA products with different terms:

| Product Term | Included |
|---|---|
| 5-Year MYGA | ✓ |
| 7-Year MYGA | ✓ |
| 10-Year MYGA | ✓ |

You will see how term length affects:
- interest guarantees
- surrender charge schedules
- renewal behavior
- cash surrender values

---

## What You Will Be Able To Do

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Explain MYGA products clearly and accurately
- Translate contract features into cash flow logic
- Build a MYGA illustration model in Python
- Analyze how withdrawals, surrender charges, and guarantees interact
- Communicate mechanics using structured tables, formulas, and documentation

## Lessons

Course content is organized under the `lessons/` directory. Each lesson typically includes:
- class material (`CM*.md`)
- homework (`HW*.md`)
- supporting notes/examples (when applicable)

!!! abstract "Maintaining the site"
    To add a new lesson:
    1. Create a folder such as `lessons/02-...`
    2. Add `CM2.md`, `HW2.md`, etc.
    3. Update navigation in `mkdocs.yml` (recommended)

---

## Recommended Workflow

1. Read the class material before the session
2. Attend the live lesson
3. Complete homework (concept + Python)
4. Review feedback and iterate

This mirrors how actuarial work is reviewed and improved in professional settings.
