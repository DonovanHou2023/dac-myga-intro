# Homepage

!!! abstract "Program focus"
    This site hosts the **MYGA Foundation Course**, a hands-on program focused on:
    
    - understanding **MYGA contract mechanics**
    - translating contracts into **cash flow logic**
    - building a **Python-based illustration engine**
    - developing **statutory reserving intuition** (CARVM → VM-22)

    The material mirrors how annuity products are analyzed, implemented,
    and explained in real actuarial work.

## How the course is structured?

This course is built around **three tightly connected components**:

- **Classes** — learn concepts, product mechanics, and valuation logic  
- **Homework** — test understanding with conceptual and Python exercises  
- **Projects** — milestone builds that integrate everything into reusable tools  

!!! note "Learning philosophy"
    Projects are designed as **working systems**, not demos.  
    The goal is to leave with intuition *and* code you can explain.

## Course Roadmap (Classes)

The course is delivered across **five core classes**, each building toward a complete
MYGA illustration and reserving system.

| Class | Focus | What you’ll learn |
|---|---|---|
| **[Class 1](class_materials/cm1.md)** | Actuarial foundations | Probability, survival notation, life contingencies, time value of money |
| **[Class 2](class_materials/cm2.md)** | Annuities & MYGA basics | MYGA structure, crediting, guarantees, withdrawals, MVA intuition |
| **[Class 3](class_materials/cm3.md)** | Assets & ALM | Bond cash flows, pricing, duration, ALM logic behind MYGA products |
| **[Class 4](class_materials/cm4.md)** | CARVM reserving | Benefit paths, maximum-value logic, discounting, statutory reserve intuition |
| **[Class 5](class_materials/cm5.md)** | VM-22 framework | Deterministic & stochastic reserves, surplus testing, VM-22 vs CARVM |
